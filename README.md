ProjectLog[0] - In this series of project logs, i will be working on my OOJS skills, by building a simple bouncing balls project with HTML, CSS and JS. </br>
ProjectLog[1] - Modelled the balls for the program using the inbuilt functions. </br>
ProjectLog[2] - Learnt to animate shapes using Javascript, animated the movement of the balls. </br>
